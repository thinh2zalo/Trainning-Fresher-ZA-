##Usage

To use it, your collection cell should subclass `CADRACSwippableCell` and you should provide a `revealView` to be shown beneath the cell and for the cell to be swippable. 

After that, you can subscribe to `revealViewSignal` to get `:next` events when the reveal view is hidden/shown. You can also provide the allowed swipe direction with `allowedDirection`.

```objc
- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    CustomCollectionCell *cell = [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"ReuseIdentifier" forIndexPath:indexPath];
    
    UIView *bottomView = [[UIView alloc] init];
    bottomView.frame = (CGRect){
        .size = CGSizeMake(CGRectGetWidth(collectionView.bounds)/2, CGRectGetHeight(cell.bounds))
    };
    
    cell.allowedDirection = arc4random_uniform(2);
    cell.revealView = bottomView;
    [[cell.revealViewSignal filter:^BOOL(NSNumber *isRevealed) {
        return [isRevealed boolValue];
    }] subscribeNext:^(id x) {
        [[self.collectionView visibleCells] enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(CustomCollectionCell *otherCell, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
            if (otherCell != cell)
            {
                [otherCell hideRevealViewAnimated:YES];
            }
        }];
    }];
    
    bottomView.backgroundColor = cell.allowedDirection == CADRACSwippableCellAllowedDirectionRight ? [UIColor redColor] : [UIColor blueColor];
    
    return cell;
}
```

Refer to the header file [`CADRACSwippableCell.h`](Source/CADRACSwippableCell.h) for more documentation.

###Install
We strongly encourage you to use Cocoapods. It's simple, just add the dependency to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'

pod 'CADRACSwippableCell'
```

And then running `pod install` will install the dependencies.

Finally, import the header file wherever you want to use it:

```objc
#import "CADRACSwippableCell.h"
```

And you are done!


### Demo

To check the demo, first install the dependencies with Cocoapods. After that, build and run the `Example` project in Xcode.
